## ðŸ“š A bit of my background

Before diving into the data world, I was a **Math Olympiad competitor** (OBMEP, OBM, OPRM).  
That experience shaped how I think: with logic, structure, and persistence. It taught me how to break down tough problems â€” a skill I now bring into every project I work on.
