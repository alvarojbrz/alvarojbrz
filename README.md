# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm a **Data Scientist**, interested in Finance, with **3 years of experience** in:

- Data analysis  
- Data integration and ETL  
- Building dashboards and management reports  

What drives me is solving problems through data. I love turning complex information into clear, actionable insights that help people make better decisions.

## ðŸ“š A bit of my background

Before diving into the data world, I was a **Math Olympiad competitor** (OBMEP, OBM, OPRM).  
That experience shaped how I think: with logic, structure, and persistence. It taught me how to break down tough problems â€” a skill I now bring into every project I work on.
